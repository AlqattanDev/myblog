# üîß Blog Command Templates

Specialized command templates for the Astro blog project that coordinate development workflows for blog-specific tasks.

## Overview

These commands are optimized for the GitHub-synced blog system built with Astro. Each command:

- **Understands blog architecture**: Two-repository system with webhook integration
- **Focuses on blog workflows**: Content management, theme system, and deployment

## Blog Workflow Patterns

### Content Development
```bash
/blog-content "analyze current content structure"  # Understand content system
# ... work on content features ...
/blog-dev "content processing optimization"        # Implement changes
/blog-deploy "test content sync"                   # Verify integration
```

### Theme Development
```bash
/blog-theme "implement dark mode system"           # Design theme system
# ... develop theme components ...
/blog-dev "test theme integration"                 # Verify implementation
/code-review "review theme system"                 # Quality check
```

### Deployment Setup
```bash
/blog-deploy setup                                 # Configure GitHub integration
# ... set up webhooks and pages ...
/blog-content "test content fetching"              # Verify content sync
/blog-dev "test full workflow"                     # End-to-end testing
```

### Feature Development
```bash
/blog-dev "add syntax highlighting with copy buttons" # Start development
# ... implement feature ...
/blog-theme "style code blocks"                    # Theme integration
/code-review "review syntax highlighting feature"   # Quality check
```

## Architecture Understanding

### Two-Repository System
- **blog-code** (this repo): Astro site code and configuration
- **blog-content**: Markdown posts and assets
- **Integration**: GitHub API + webhooks for content sync

### Key Technologies
- **Astro**: Static site generator with content collections
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with theme system
- **GitHub Pages**: Static hosting with custom domain
- **Markdown**: Advanced content parsing with frontmatter

### Content Flow
1. Content updated in blog-content repository
2. Webhook triggers rebuild of blog-code repository  
3. Astro fetches content via GitHub API during build
4. Static site generates with updated content
5. GitHub Pages deploys to custom domain

## Command Integration

Blog-specific commands work together:
- **`/blog-dev`** provides development guidance
- **`/blog-content`** handles content management  
- **`/blog-deploy`** manages GitHub integration
- **`/blog-theme`** handles design system

General commands supplement blog workflows:
- **`/full-context`** for deep analysis
- **`/code-review`** for quality assurance
- **`/gemini-consult`** for complex decisions

## Key Principles

1. **Blog-first approach** - Commands understand the unique blog architecture
2. **Content-driven development** - Always consider content structure impact
3. **GitHub integration** - Respect the two-repository workflow
4. **Performance focused** - Optimize for static generation and fast loading
5. **Theme consistency** - Maintain design system across all features
